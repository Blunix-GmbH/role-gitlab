# Ansible Role gitlab
This role installs and configures a gitlab server.

# BUGS
There seems to be a bug in gitlab atm where `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` fails. This is bad, because without the first `gitlab-ctl` reconfigure run, no `gitlab-psql` Linux user exists and we cant apply the fix in a task. Hence, run the command yourself and then manually do the fix:
```
root@xenial:~# gitlab-ctl reconfigure
[...]
Running handlers:
There was an error running gitlab-ctl reconfigure:

execute[/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/initdb -D /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data -E UTF8] (postgresql::enable line 80) had an error: Mixlib::ShellOut::ShellCommandFailed: Expected process to exit with [0], but received '1'

root@xenial:~# su -l gitlab-psql --shell=/bin/bash
gitlab-psql@xenial:~$ /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/initdb -D /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data -E UTF8
```

NOTE: this is why the tests fail atm.

# TODO
- resetting the admin password should be automated, preferably in a script
- add a molecule test that curls the login page | grep login
- add LDAP for users

# Example play
An example play can be found in `molecule/install/playbook.yml`

# Requirements
You need to setup ssl / letsencrypt certificates so gitlab can use them.

# Maintenance
- update the nginx ssl ciphers in `defaults/main.yml` using the mozilla ssl config generator
